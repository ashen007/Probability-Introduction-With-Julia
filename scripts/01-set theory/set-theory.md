## what is a set?

a set is a collection of objects. the objects can be anything, for example numbers, people,
even another set. set theory allows a language to talk about events.

### how to define a set

there are two type of sets one is that all elements are countable and other one that all 
possible elements are not clear or has infinite number of them. in the first case thoes
possible values can be show as a list of elements. for example,

$${
    \lbrace HH, HT, TH, TT \rbrace \text{in two coin flips} \\
    \text{R is the set of all real numbers}
}$$

in second case can use rule that says wheather each possible object is or isn't in the set.
for example,

$${
    \lbrace (x, y) \in R^2 : x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 \rbrace \\
    this rule state "disk of radius 1 in the plane $R^2$, centered at the origin".
}$$
